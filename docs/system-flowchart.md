# Community Service Tracker System Flowchart

This flowchart represents the architecture and flow of the Community Service Tracker System. The system is divided into several main components:

1. **Authentication**
   - Handles user login and role-based access control
   - Routes users to appropriate dashboards based on their role

2. **Student Flow**
   - Allows students to submit service requests
   - Enables tracking of service hours
   - Facilitates submission of completion reports

3. **Supervisor Flow**
   - Manages student request reviews
   - Monitors service progress
   - Verifies completed hours
   - Generates reports

4. **Admin Flow**
   - Manages user accounts
   - Configures system settings
   - Views analytics
   - Generates system-wide reports

5. **Verification Process**
   - Handles the review and approval of completed service
   - Manages certificate generation

6. **Reports & Analytics**
   - Consolidates data from various sources
   - Generates comprehensive reports
   - Provides export functionality

The system uses a role-based access control system to ensure proper separation of concerns and maintain data security.
